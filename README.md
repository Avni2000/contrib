OpenMS contrib
=============

This directory contains the OpenMS contrib package.

If you downloaded a stable release, detailed installation
instructions and other information can be found in the
documentation (```OpenMS/doc/index.html```).

If this is a development version obtained via git or as
nightly snapshot, the documentation is not contained
in this package. Please refer to the OpenMS website
http://www.openms.de for installation instructions.

Please note that an internet connection is required to
build the contrib since the actual source packages are
only downloaded when build.
